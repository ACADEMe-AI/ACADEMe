Desert Adaptation – Animals in deserts store water and have light-colored bodies to reflect heat. Example: camel, fennec fox.  \\n3. Water Adaptation – Aquatic animals have fins and gills to swim and breathe underwater. Example: fish, dolphin.  \\n4. Camouflage – Some animals blend with their surroundings to hide from predators. Example: chameleon, tiger.  \\n5. Mimicry – Some animals copy the appearance of others to avoid being eaten. Example: stick insect, butterfly.  \\n6.

    "e75f0743-95dd-4ddb-8e8f-2c8690bd14b2": "# Life in Space – People Who Built the Space Station\\nJust like great forts and buildings on Earth, the amazing space stations floating above us were also made by the **hard work of many people**! These space homes were not built by one person, but by teams of **scientists, engineers, space designers, and technicians** from different countries working together. They designed and created each part carefully so that astronauts could live safely in space where there is **no gravity** and no air. The pieces of the space station were built on Earth and then sent into space using powerful **rockets**. In space, astronauts and machines helped **join these parts** like a giant puzzle. These builders had to think about every little thing—how the astronauts would **breathe, eat, sleep, and work** inside. They made special systems for **oxygen, water recycling, temperature control**, and even exercise! Just like masons and workers build strong walls and decorate them on Earth, space builders created floating rooms where astronauts can live for months. The space station is like a **science house in the sky**, and every nut, wire, and wall in it tells the story of the smart and brave people who imagined and built it together for the whole world!",
    "01e31f80-b7df-437f-b8e7-073f1ce4024a": "# Gravity and Weightlessness\\nGravity is what keeps our feet on the ground! It is the **invisible force** that pulls everything towards the Earth. That’s why when we throw a ball up, it always comes down. But in space, things are very different—there is **no gravity** or very, very little of it. This is called **weightlessness**, and it makes everything float! Astronauts like Sunita Williams experienced this when she went to space. In her spacecraft, she didn’t walk or sit like we do on Earth—she had to **float** from one place to another. Even simple things like eating or brushing teeth became fun and tricky because nothing stays in one place unless it is tied down. If you drop a pencil, it won’t fall—it will just float in the air! This happens because there is no strong gravity to pull it down. Gravity is what gives us **weight**, so without it, things feel **weightless**. That’s why astronauts train a lot before going to space, so they can learn how to move and work in this floating world. Understanding gravity and weightlessness helps us know how different space is from Earth and how amazing it is to live in a place where everything seems to fly!",
    "9caf3b4f-896f-42ab-8ed0-dfb0b64e91f0": "# The Earth from Space\\nSeeing the Earth from space is a truly magical experience! Astronauts like **Sunita Williams** have shared how our planet looks like a beautiful **blue and white ball** floating in the darkness of space. From far above, Earth doesn’t look divided into countries or cities—it looks peaceful, round, and glowing. The **blue colour** comes from the oceans and seas, while the **white swirls** are clouds floating in the atmosphere. At night, astronauts can see tiny **lights from cities**, and during the day, they can spot **rivers, mountains, forests, and even storms** moving across the globe. There is no noise, no traffic—just the quiet view of our amazing planet turning slowly. Watching the Earth from space helps us understand how **small and special** our world is in the vast universe. It also makes us realise that we all share the same planet, and we must take care of it together. Seeing Earth from space is not just science—it’s a moment of wonder that fills the heart with joy, pride, and a deep respect for our beautiful home.",
    "26019271-bcd0-41cc-84eb-9be757a98cc0": "# What If Water Finishes?\\nWater is one of the most important things on Earth, and we use it every single day—for drinking, cooking, cleaning, bathing, and growing food. But have you ever thought, what if one day all the clean water gets used up? It may seem hard to imagine, but if we don’t take care of our water sources, we might face a big problem. Without water, plants won’t grow, animals won’t survive, and we humans will find it very hard to live. Rivers, lakes, and ponds are drying up in many places because of **overuse**, **wastage**, and **pollution**. In some villages and cities, people already have to walk long distances to get water, or wait for hours for water tanks to arrive. Water is precious, and nature gives us only a limited amount of clean water that we can use. If we keep wasting it, there may not be enough left for everyone in the future. Just like we save money or food, we must also learn to **save water**. Every drop is valuable, and saving water today means a better and safer tomorrow for all living things on Earth!",
    "bceb3a1e-b060-43a5-88af-bb184b4b3810": "# What If Electricity Finishes?\\nElectricity is something we use all the time, often without even thinking about it! We use it to **light our homes**, **run fans**, **charge phones**, **watch TV**, and even to **cook food**. But what if one day, electricity suddenly stopped and didn’t come back? Everything around us would change. There would be no lights in our houses, streets would be dark, and fridges, computers, and machines would stop working. Schools, hospitals, shops, and traffic signals all need electricity to work properly. Even water pumps that bring water to our taps use electricity! Most of the electricity we use comes from **burning fuels like coal and oil**, which are limited and can get over one day if we keep using them carelessly. That’s why we must understand how important electricity is and how we should use it **wisely and carefully**. Saving electricity by switching off lights and fans when not needed, using sunlight during the day, and learning about **renewable energy** like solar and wind power can help us protect our future. Electricity is a powerful gift, and we must learn to **use it, not waste it**!",
    "7a39ea37-c563-4855-b179-e367555e41c7": "# What If Trees Finish?\\nTrees are one of the most important gifts of nature, and we see them all around us in parks, forests, gardens, and along roads. But have you ever wondered what would happen if trees finished one day? Trees give us **fresh air** to breathe by taking in carbon dioxide and giving out **oxygen**. They also give us **shade**, **fruits**, **wood**, and even medicines. Trees help keep the weather cool and prevent **soil erosion** by holding the soil with their roots. Animals like birds, monkeys, and squirrels live in trees, and many people depend on them for their jobs and homes too. If trees disappeared, there would be **less oxygen**, more pollution, hotter temperatures, and fewer homes for animals. The Earth would not look green and beautiful anymore. Trees also help bring rain and keep the balance of nature. Cutting down too many trees is called **deforestation**, and it is very harmful to the planet. We must learn to **plant more trees**, **take care of them**, and understand their value before it's too late. Trees are not just plants—they are life-givers, and without them, life on Earth would be very hard.",
    "8d0b6bf9-134b-4b33-bdd3-2c067c3ecef1": "# What If Petrol and Diesel Finishes?\\nPetrol and diesel are fuels that help cars, buses, trucks, trains, and even some machines run. Every day, we use them to travel to school, go to the market, move goods, and do farming. But have you ever thought what would happen if petrol and diesel finish one day? These fuels come from **deep under the Earth** and take **millions of years** to form, so they are not something we can make again quickly. If they run out, most of our vehicles would stop moving, and many factories and machines would not work. People would have to walk or use **bicycles, bullock carts, or electric vehicles**. Transporting food and goods would become slow and expensive. Petrol and diesel also cause **air pollution**, so using less of them helps keep the air clean. Scientists and engineers are already trying to find other ways to run vehicles—like using **solar energy**, **wind energy**, and **battery-powered engines**. Understanding how important these fuels are teaches us to use them **wisely**, only when needed, and to look for **cleaner and safer** options for the future. Petrol and diesel may not last forever, so saving them is a smart and responsible step for everyone!",

Since the temperature is very low and snowfall is common, people make houses that are **strong, warm, and safe**. Most mountain houses have **sloping roofs** so that snow can slide off easily and does not collect on top. The walls are made thick using **stone, wood, or mud bricks** to keep the inside warm. Many houses are built on **raised platforms or wooden stilts** to protect them from dampness and cold ground. In areas like Ladakh, people use **locally available stones and wood** because carrying materials from far places is difficult due to narrow and hilly roads. Some houses have **small windows** to keep the heat in and **flat roofs** where people dry vegetables for winter. Each type of house is designed thoughtfully to match the needs of the people and the nature around them. Even in the toughest weather, these shelters give comfort and protection, showing how wisely people live with nature in the mountains.",

These places are located **high up in the mountains**, where the air is **thin**, the weather is **very cold**, and the land is often **rocky and uneven**. Because of less oxygen, people living here need to be **physically strong** and well-adjusted to the height. They wear **thick woollen clothes**, **cover their heads and ears**, and eat **warm, energy-giving food** to stay healthy. Houses in such areas are made with **local materials** like stone and wood to keep them warm and strong against strong winds and snow. Water freezes quickly, and sometimes it is stored in tanks or melted from ice. In places like Ladakh, life can be tough, but people still live happily by depending on **animals like yaks and sheep**, growing crops like **barley and potatoes**, and by working together as a close community. Roads may be blocked due to snow, and walking long distances is common. Yet, the people are cheerful, brave, and used to facing challenges. Life in high altitudes teaches us how humans can **adjust to even the harshest conditions** by using nature wisely and living simply.",

In places like Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, life is simple yet full of colour and warmth. The mountain people wear **traditional woollen clothes**, like long coats, boots, and colourful caps, to protect themselves from the cold. Their houses are made of **stone, wood, or mud bricks**, built strong to face the snow and chilly winds. The food they eat is hot and healthy—like **thukpa (noodle soup)**, **momos**, **barley roti**, and **butter tea**, which give energy and keep the body warm. Mountain communities celebrate festivals with great joy—dancing, singing, wearing bright clothes, and offering prayers. Their music and art reflect **nature, animals, and religion**, and most people follow **Buddhism or Hinduism**. People here are known for being **kind, hardworking, and peaceful**, living in harmony with nature. Since life in the mountains is not easy, the people depend on **teamwork, simple living, and strong traditions**.

The weather is often **very cold**, and there is heavy **snowfall** in winter, which can block roads and make travel difficult. The air is **thin and has less oxygen**, which makes breathing harder, especially for people not used to such heights. Carrying goods, water, or building materials becomes tough because the **land is steep and uneven**, and there are fewer vehicles. In many places, people walk long distances to school, market, or hospital. In winter, water **freezes in pipes**, and people must melt snow or store water in advance. There are fewer shops or medical centres, and getting help during an emergency can take a long time. Farming is difficult too, as the soil is rocky and the growing season is short. Even simple tasks like cooking or staying warm need extra effort and planning. Yet, people in mountain regions live bravely by adjusting to nature, using **local materials**, and depending on **each other’s support**.
